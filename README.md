In this repository, I have created a crystal collector game. This took HTML, minimal CSS, Jquery, Bootstrap, and Google Fonts to curate this game. For styling, I really wanted to go very minimal and create a simplistic look to the page. I felt that having a lavender colored jumbotron would compliment the crystal images that I chose for this game. I also do want to point out that selecting a transparent image of the crystals really made this page pop and look very aesthetically pleasing.

Below I will display my pseudocode when planning out this game from the start.

psuedo code for crystal collector game//

// create a game with 4 crystals with each crystal having a random integer
// every crystal should have a random number between 1-12
// The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120.
// every random number with each crystal should generate every time a new game begins
// when the user clicks a crystal, the total score of the user will go up depending on the value of the random number that is given to that crystal
// the objective of the game is to match your score with the set number that is to attain
// if the user's score is greater than the set number to match, then the user loses
// if the user's score maxScore === getRandomNum then the user wins the game
